# Bowling Kata Rules

The [KataBowling](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBowling) challenge, based on a game of standard 10-pin American bowling.

* 10 pins
* 10 turns (frames) for the bowler
* 2 tries per turn
* If fails to knock both down, score for that frame is sum of rolls
* Spare: knocks down 10 on roll 2. Score is 10 + next throw score
* Strike knocks down 10 on roll 1. Score is 10 + next 2 throw scores
* Spare or strike on last turn (frame 10), gets 1 or 2 bonus balls. Count as same turn.
